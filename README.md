### Premise

At the time of writing this, I have 5 hours on Godot and very little Game Dev experience, so this project is gonna infested by bad choices and reduced overall vision.

### Description

That's a practice Godot project in which I try to reproduce as much as possible of [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/).

### First Iteration

I expect the focus mainly on the basic game mechanics.
The visuals and audio will come later.
